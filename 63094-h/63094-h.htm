<p>The main purpose of home-sewerage works is to get rid of sewage
in such way as (1) to guard against the transmission of disease
germs through drinking water, flies, or other means; (2) to avoid
creating nuisance. What is the best method and what the best outfit
are questions not to be answered offhand from afar. A treatment
that is a success in one location may be a failure in another. In
every instance decision should be based upon field data and full
knowledge of the local needs and conditions. An installation planned
from assumed conditions may work harm. The householder may be
misled as to the purification and rely on a protection that is not real.
He may anticipate little or no odor and find a nuisance has been
created.</p>

<p>Though specific plans can not be sent in the absence of definite information,
and though plans and specifications can not be prepared
to meet individual requirements, the Division of Agricultural Engineering,
Bureau of Public Roads, gladly gives such help as is possible.
To those who contemplate installing sewerage works on farms
and who furnish the information outlined under the caption "Field
data," on <a href="#Field_data">page 52</a>, plans, advice, or suggestions will be sent. Local
requirements are frequently met or approximated by one of the designs
on hand; working drawings in the form of blue prints will then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[ 4 ]</span>
be furnished. Sometimes the designs, slightly modified, may suit the
needs. In other instances it is sufficient to send published bulletins
or give written suggestions of a practical nature.</p>

<p>Human excrements (feces and urine) as found in closets and privy
vaults are known as night soil. These wastes may be flushed away
with running water, and there may be added the discharges from
washbasins, bathtubs, kitchen and slop sinks, laundry trays, washing
vats, and floor drains. This refuse liquid product is sewage, and the
underground pipe which conveys it is a sewer. Since sewers carry
foul matter they should be water-tight, and this feature of their
construction distinguishes them from drains removing relatively
pure surface or ground water. Sewerage refers to a system of
sewers, including the pipes, tanks, disposal works, and appurtenances.</p>

<p>Under average conditions a man discharges daily about 3&frac12; ounces
of moist feces and 40 ounces of urine, the total in a year approximating
992 pounds.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Feces consist largely of water and undigested or
partially digested food; by weight it is 77.2 per cent water. 2 Urine
is about 96.3 per cent water.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The excrements constitute but a small part of ordinary sewage.
In addition to the excrements and the daily water consumption of
perhaps 40 gallons per person are many substances entering into
the economy of the household, such as grease, fats, milk, bits of food,
meat, fruit, and vegetables, tea and coffee grounds, paper, etc. This
complex product contains mineral, vegetable, and animal substances,
both dissolved and undissolved. It contains dead organic matter
and living organisms in the form of exceedingly minute vegetative
cells (bacteria) and animal cells (protozoa). These low forms of
life are the active agents in destroying dead organic matter.</p>

<p>The bacteria are numbered in billions and include many species,
some useful and others harmful. They may be termed tiny scavengers,
which under favorable conditions multiply with great rapidity,
their useful work being the oxidizing and nitrifying of dissolved
organic matter and the breaking down of complex organic solids to
liquids and gases. Among the myriads of bacteria are many of a
virulent nature. These at any time may include species which are
the cause of well-known infections and parasitic diseases.</p>

<p>Any spittoon, slop pail, sink drain, urinal, privy, cesspool, sewage
tank, or sewage distribution field is a potential danger. A bit of
spit, urine, or feces the size of a pin head may contain many hundred
germs, all invisible to the naked eye and each one capable of producing
disease. These discharges should be kept away from the food
and drink of man and animals. From specific germs that may be
carried in sewage at any time there may result typhoid fever, tuberculosis,
cholera, dysentery, diarrhea, and other dangerous ailments,
and it is probable that other maladies may be traced to human waste.
From certain animal parasites or their eggs that may be carried in
sewage there may result intestinal worms, of which the more common
are the hookworm, roundworm, whipworm, eelworm, tapeworm, and
seat worm.</p>

<p>Sewage, drainage, or other impure water may contain also the
causative agents of numerous ailments common to live stock, such
as tuberculosis, foot-and-mouth disease, hog cholera, anthrax, glanders,
and stomach and intestinal worms.</p>

<p>Disease germs are carried by many agencies and unsuspectingly
received by devious routes into the human body. Infection may
come from the swirling dust of the railway roadbed, from contact
with transitory or chronic carriers of disease, from green truck
grown in gardens fertilized with night soil or sewage, from food
prepared or touched by unclean hands or visited by flies or vermin,
from milk handled by sick or careless dairymen, from milk cans and
utensils washed with contaminated water, or from cisterns, wells,
springs, reservoirs, irrigation ditches, brooks, or lakes receiving the
surface wash or the underground drainage from sewage-polluted soil.</p>

<p>Many recorded examples show with certainty how typhoid fever
and other diseases have been transmitted. A few indicating the
responsibilities and duties of people who live in the country are
cited here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In August, 1889, a sister and two brothers aged 18, 21, and 23
years, respectively, and all apparently in robust health dwelt together
in a rural village in Columbiana County, Ohio. Typhoid
fever in particularly virulent form developed after use of drinking
water from a badly polluted surface source. The deaths of all three
occurred within a space of 10 days.</p>

<p>In September and October, 1899, 63 cases of typhoid fever, resulting
in 5 deaths, occurred at the Northampton (Mass.) insane hospital.
This epidemic was conclusively traced to celery, which was
eaten freely in August and was grown and banked in a plot that
had been fertilized in the late winter or early spring with the solid
residue and scrapings from a sewage filter bed situated on the
hospital grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[ 6 ]</span></p>

<p>Some years ago Dr. W. W. Skinner, Bureau of Chemistry, Department
of Agriculture, investigated the cause of an outbreak of typhoid
fever in southwest Virginia. A small stream meandered through a
narrow valley in which five 10-inch wells about 450 feet deep had
been drilled in limestone formation. The wells were from 50 to 400
feet from the stream, from which, it was suspected, pollution was
reaching the wells. In a pool in the stream bed approximately one-fourth
mile above the wells several hundred pounds of common salt
were dissolved. Four of the wells were cut off from the pump and
the fifth was subjected to heavy pumping. The water discharged
by the pump was examined at 15-minute intervals and its salt content
determined over a considerable period of time. After the lapse
of several 15-minute intervals the salt began to rise and continued to
rise until the maximum was approximately seven times that at the
beginning of the test, thus proving the facility with which pollution
may pass a long distance underground and reach deep wells.</p>

<p>Probably no epidemic in American history better illustrates the
dire results that may follow one thoughtless act than the outbreak of
typhoid fever at Plymouth, Pa., in 1885. In January and February
of that year the night discharges of one typhoid fever patient were
thrown out upon the snow near his home. These, carried by spring
thaws into the public water supply, caused an epidemic running from
April to September. In a total population of about 8,000, 1,104 persons
were attacked by the disease and 114 died.</p></div>

<p>Like plants and animals, disease germs vary in their powers of
resistance. Some are hardy, others succumb easily. Outside the
body most of them probably die in a few days or weeks. It is never
certain when such germs may not lodge where the immediate surroundings
are favorable to their life and reproduction. Milk is one
of the common substances in which germs multiply rapidly. The
experience at Northampton shows that typhoid-fever germs may
survive several months in garden soil. Laboratory tests by the
United States Public Health Service showed that typhoid-fever
germs had not all succumbed after being frozen in cream 74 days.
(Public Health Reports, Feb. 8, 1918, pp. 163-166.) Ravenel kept
the spores of anthrax immersed for 244 days in the strongest tanning
fluids without perceptible change in their vitality or virulence.
(Annual Report, State Department of Health, Mass., 1916, p. 494.)</p>

<p><b>Unsafe practices.</b>&mdash;Upon thousands of small farms there are no
privies and excretions are deposited carelessly about the premises.
A place of this character is shown in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>. Upon thousands of
other farms the privy is so filthy and neglected that hired men and
visitors seek near-by sheds, fields, and woods. A privy of this character
is shown in <a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>. These practices and conditions exist in
every section of the country. They should be abolished.</p>

<p>Deserving of severe censure is the old custom of conveying excrements
or sewage into abandoned wells or some convenient stream.
Such a practice is indecent and unsafe. It is unnecessary and is
contrary to the laws of most of the States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[ 7 ]</span></p>

<p>Likewise dangerous and even more disgusting is the old custom of
using human excrement or sewage for the fertilization of truck land.
Under no circumstances should such wastes be used on land devoted
to celery, lettuce, radishes, cucumbers, cabbages, tomatoes, melons,
or other vegetables, berries, or low-growing fruits that are eaten raw.
Disease germs or particles of soil containing such germs may adhere
to the skins of vegetables or fruits and infect the eater.</p>

<p>Upon farms it is necessary to dispose of excretal wastes at no great
distance from the dwelling. The ability and likelihood of flies
carrying disease germs direct to the dinner table, kitchen, or pantry
are well known. Vermin, household pets, poultry, and live stock may
spread such germs. For these reasons, and also on the score of odor,
farm sewage never should be exposed.</p>

<p><b>Important safety measure.</b>&mdash;The farmer can do no other one thing
so vital to his own and the public health as to make sure of the continued
purity of the farm water supply. Investigations indicate
that about three out of four shallow wells are polluted badly.</p>

<p>Wells and springs are fed by ground water, which is merely natural
drainage. Drainage water usually moves with the slope of the
land. It always dissolves part of the mineral, vegetable, and animal
matter of the ground over or through which it moves. In this way
impurities are carried into the ground water and may reach distant
wells or springs.</p>

<p>The great safeguards are clean ground and wide separation of the
well from probable channels of impure drainage water. It is not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[ 8 ]</span>
enough that a well or spring is 50 or 150 feet from a source of filth
or that it is on higher ground. Given porous ground, a seamy ledge,
or long-continued pollution of one plat of land, the zone of contamination
is likely to extend long distances, particularly in downhill
directions or when the water is low through drought or heavy pumping.
Only when the surface of the water in a well or spring is at a
higher level at all times than any near-by
source of filth is there assurance
of safety from impure seepage. Some
of the foregoing facts are shown diagrammatically
in <a href="#fig3">figure 3</a>. <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>
is typical of those insanitary, poorly
drained barnyards that are almost certain
to work injury to wells situated

<p>Sewage or impure drainage water

Neither should such wastes be discharged
into 'Openings in rock, an
abandoned well, nor a hole, cesspool,

can escape into water-bearing
earth or rock. Whatever the system of
sewage disposal, it should be entirely
and widely separated from the water

<h2><a id="HOW_SEWAGE_DECOMPOSES"></a>HOW SEWAGE DECOMPOSES.</h2>
</div>


<p>When a bottle of fresh sewage is kept in a warm room changes
occur in the appearance and nature of the liquid. At first it is light
in appearance and its odor is slight. It is well supplied with oxygen,
since this gas is always found in waters exposed to the atmosphere.
In a few hours the solids in the sewage separate mechanically according
to their relative weights; sediment collects at the bottom, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[ 10 ]</span>
a greasy film covers the surface. In a day's time there is an enormous
development of bacteria, which obtain their food supply from the
dissolved carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter. As long as free
oxygen is present this action is spoken of as aërobic decomposition.
There is a gradual increase in the amount of ammonia and a decrease
of free oxygen, the latter going to support bacterial life.
When the ammonia is near the maximum and the free oxygen is exhausted
the sewage is said to be stale. Following exhaustion of the
oxygen supply, bacterial life continues profuse, but it gradually
diminishes as a result of reduction of its food supply and the poisonous
effects of its own wastes. In the absence of oxygen the bacterial
action is spoken of as anaërobic decomposition. The sewage turns
darker and becomes more offensive. Suspended and settled organic
substances break apart or liquefy later, and various foul-smelling
gases are liberated. Sewage in this condition is known as septic
and the putrefaction that has taken place is called septicization. The
odor eventually disappears, and a dark, insoluble, mosslike substance
remains as a deposit. Complete reduction of this deposit may
require many years.</p>

<p>Decomposition of organic matter by bacterial agency is not a
complete method of treating sewage, as will be shown later under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[ 11 ]</span>
"Septic tanks." It is sufficient to observe here that in all practical
methods of treatment aeration plays a vital part. The air or the
sewage, or both, must be in a finely divided state, as when sewage
percolates through the interstices of a porous, air-filled soil. The
principle involved was clearly stated 30 years ago by Hiram F. Mills,
a member of the Massachusetts State Board of Health. In discussing
the intermittent filtration of sewage through gravel stones too
coarse to arrest even the coarsest particles in the sewage Mr. Mills
said: "The slow movement of the sewage in thin films over the
surface of the stones, with air in contact, caused a removal for some
months of 97 per cent of the organic nitrogenous matter, as well
as 99 per cent of the bacteria."</p>

<p>Previous discussion has dealt largely with basic principles of
sanitation. The construction and operation of simple utilities embodying
some of these principles are discussed in the following order:
(1) Privies for excrements only; (2) works for handling wastes
where a supply of water is available for flushing.</p>

<h3><a id="PIT_PRIVY"></a>PIT PRIVY.</h3>

<p><a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a> shows a portable pit privy suitable for places of the
character of that shown in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>, where land is abundant and
cheap, and in such localities has proved practical. It provides, at
minimum cost and with least attention, a fixed place for depositing
excretions where the filth can not be tracked by man, spread by
animals, reached by flies, nor washed by rain.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe25_6875" id="fig7">
  <a href="images/fig7lrg.png"><img class="w100" src="images/fig7.png"  alt="" /></a>
  <div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Portable pit privy. For use where land is abundant and cheap, but unless
  handled with judgment can not be regarded as safe. The privy is mounted on runners
  for convenience in moving to new locations.<br />Click on image to view larger size.</div>
</div>

<p>The privy is light and inexpensive and is placed over a pit in the
ground. When the pit becomes one-half or two-thirds full the privy
is drawn or carried to a new location. The pit should be shallow,
preferably not over 2&frac12; feet in depth, and never should be located in
wet ground or rock formation or where the surface or the strata slope
toward a well, spring, or other source of domestic water supply. Besides
standing on lower ground the pit should never be within 200
feet of a well or spring. Since dryness in the pit is essential, the
ground should be raised slightly and 10 or 12 inches of earth should
be banked and compacted against all sides to shed rain water. The
banking also serves to exclude flies. If the soil is sandy or gravelly,
the pit should be lined with boards or pales to prevent caving. The
privy should be boarded closely and should be provided with screened
openings for ventilation and light. The screens may consist of
standard galvanized or black enameled wire cloth having 14 squares
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[ 13 ]</span>
to the inch. The whole seat should be easily removable for cleaning.
A little loose absorbent soil should be added daily to the accumulation
in the pit, and when a pit is abandoned it should be filled
immediately with dry earth mounded to shed water.</p>

<p>A pit privy for use in field work, consisting of a framework of
&frac12;-inch iron pipe for corner posts connected at the top with &frac14;-inch
iron rods bent at the ends to right angles and hung with curtains of
unbleached muslin, is described in Public Health Report of the
United States Public Health Service, July 26, 1918.</p>

<p>A pit privy, even if moved often, can not be regarded as safe.
The danger is that accumulations of waste may overtax the purifying
capacity of the soil and the leachings reach wells or springs.
Sloping ground is not a guaranty of safety; the great safeguard lies
in locating the privy a long distance from the water supply and as
far below it as possible.</p>


<h3><a id="SANITARY_PRIVY"></a>SANITARY PRIVY.</h3>

<p>The next step in evolution is the sanitary privy. Its construction
must be such that it is practically impossible for filth or germs to
be spread above ground, to escape by percolation underground, or to
be accessible to flies, vermin, chickens, or animals. Furthermore, it
must be cared for in a cleanly manner, else it ceases to be sanitary.
To secure these desirable ends sanitarians have devised numerous
types of tight-receptacle privy. Considering the small cost and the
proved value of some of these types, it is to be regretted that few
are seen on American farms.</p>

<p>The container for a sanitary privy may be small&mdash;for example, a
galvanized-iron pail or garbage can, to be removed from time to
time by hand; it may be large, as a barrel or a metal tank mounted
for moving; or it may be a stationary underground metal tank or
masonry vault. The essential requirement in the receptacle is permanent
water-tightness to prevent pollution of soils and wells.
Wooden pails or boxes, which warp and leak, should not be used.
Where a vault is used it should be shallow to facilitate emptying
and cleaning. Moreover, if the receptacle should leak it is better
that the escape of liquid should be in the top soil, where air and bacterial
life are most abundant.</p>

<p>Sanitary privies are classified according to the method used in
treating the excretions, as dry earth, chemical, liquefying.</p>


<h3><a id="DRY-EARTH_PRIVY"></a>DRY-EARTH PRIVY.</h3>

<p><b>Pail type.</b>&mdash;A very serviceable pail privy is shown in figures 8 and 9.
The method of ventilation is an adaptation of a system that has
proved very effective in barns and other buildings here and abroad.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[ 14 ]</span>
A flue with a clear opening of 16 square inches rises from the rear
of the seat and terminates above the ridge-pole in a cowl or small
roofed housing. Attached to this flue is a short auxiliary duct, 4 by
15 inches, for removing foul air from the top of the privy. In its
upper portion on the long sides the cowl is open, allowing free
movement of air across the top of the flue. In addition the long
sides of the cowl are open below next to the roof. These two openings,
with the connecting vertical air passages, permit free upward
movement of air through the cowl, as indicated by the arrows. The
combined effect is to create draft from beneath the seat and from the
top of the privy. The ventilating flue is 2 by 8 inches at the seat
and 4 by 4 inches 5 feet above. The taper slightly increases the
labor of making the flue, but permits a 2-inch reduction in the length
of the building.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[ 16 ]</span></p>

<p>In plan the privy is 4 by 4&frac12; feet. The sills are secured to durable
posts set about 4 feet in the ground. The boarding is tight, and all
vents and windows are screened to exclude insects. The screens may
be the same as for pit privies or, if a more lasting material is desired,
bronze or copper screening of 14 squares to the inch may be used.
The entire seat is hinged, thus permitting removal of the receptacle
and facilitating cleaning and washing the underside of the seat and
the destruction of spiders and other insects which thrive in dark, unclean
places. The receptacle is a heavy galvanized-iron garbage can.
Heavy brown-paper bags for lining the can may be had at slight
cost, and their use helps to keep the can clean and facilitates emptying.
Painting with black asphaltum serves a similar purpose and
protects the can from rust. If the contents are frozen, a little heat
releases them. Of nonfreezing mixtures a strong brine made with
common salt or calcium chloride is effective. Two and one-half to 3
pounds of either thoroughly dissolved in a gallon of water lowers the
freezing point of the mixture to about zero. Denatured alcohol or
wood alcohol in a 25 per cent solution has a like low freezing point
and the additional merit of being noncorrosive of metals. The can
should be emptied frequently and the contents completely buried in
a thin layer by a plow or in a shallow hand-dug trench at a point
below and remote from wells and springs. Wherever intestinal disease
exists the contents of the can should be destroyed by burning
or made sterile before burial by boiling
or by incorporation with a strong
chemical disinfectant.</p>

</div>

<p>A privy ventilated in the manner
before described is shown in <a href="#fig10">figure 10</a>. The cowl, however, is open on
four sides instead of two sides as
shown in figures <a href="#fig8">8</a> and <a href="#fig9">9</a>. The working
drawings (fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a> and <a href="#fig9">9</a>) show that
the construction of a privy of the
kind is not difficult. <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> gives
three suggestions whereby a privy may
be conveniently located and the approach
screened or partially hidden by
latticework, vines, or shrubbery.</p>

<p><b>Vault type.</b>&mdash;A primitive and yet
serviceable three-seat dry-earth privy
of the vault type is shown in <a href="#fig12">figure 12</a>.
This privy was constructed in 1817
upon a farm at Westboro, Mass. The
vault, made of bricks, was 6 feet long by 5 feet wide, and the bottom
was 1 foot below the surface of the ground. The brickwork was laid in
mortar, and the part below the ground surface was plastered on the inside.
The outside of the vault was exposed to light and air on all
four sides. Across the long side of the vault in the rear was a door
swinging upward through which the night soil was removed two or
three times a year, usually in the spring, summer, and fall, and
hauled to a near-by field, where it was deposited in a furrow, just
ahead of the plow.</p>

<p>Especial attention is called to the shallowness of the vault and the
lightened labor of cleaning it out. The swinging door at the rear
facilitated the sprinkling of dry soil or ashes over the contents of the
vault, thus avoiding the necessity of carrying dirt and dust into the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[ 17 ]</span>
building and dust settling upon the seat. This privy was in use for
nearly 100 years without renewal or repairs. When last seen the
original seat, which always was kept painted, showed no signs of
decay. Modern methods would call for a concrete vault of guaranteed
water-tightness,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> proper ventilation and screening, and hinging
the seat.</p>

<p>Working drawings for a very convenient well-built two-seat vault
privy are reproduced in figures 13 and 14. The essential features are
shown in sufficient detail to require little explanation. With concrete
mixtures of 1:2:3 (1 volume cement, 2 volumes sand, 3 volumes
stone) for the vault and
1:2:4 for the posts there
will be required a total of
about 2 cubic yards of concrete,
taking 3&frac12; barrels of
cement, 1 cubic yard of
sand, and 1&frac12; cubic yards of
broken stone or screened
gravel. The stone or
gravel should not exceed 1
inch in diameter, except
that a few cobblestones
may be embedded where
the vault wall is thickest,
thus effecting a slight saving of materials.</p>


<h3><a id="CHEMICAL_CLOSET"></a>CHEMICAL CLOSET.</h3>

<p>A type of sanitary privy
in which the excrements are
received directly into a
water-tight receptacle containing
chemical disinfectant
is meeting with considerable
favor for camps, parks,
rural cottages, schools,
hotels, and railway stations.
These chemical closets,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as
they are called, are made
in different forms and are
known by various trade
names. In the simplest
form a sheet-metal receptacle
is concealed in a small
metal or wooden cabinet, and the closet is operated usually in much
the same manner as the ordinary pail privy. These closets are very
simple and compact, of good appearance, and easy to install or move
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[ 19 ]</span>
from place to place. In another type, known as the chemical tank
closet, the receptacle is a steel tank fixed in position underground or
in a basement. The tank has a capacity of about 125 gallons per
seat, is provided with a hand-operated agitator to secure thorough
mixing of the chemical and the excretions, and the contents are
bailed, pumped, or drained out from time to time.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Chemical closets, like every form of privy, should be well installed,
cleanly operated, and frequently emptied, and the wastes should receive
safe burial. With exception of frequency of emptying, the
same can be said of chemical tank closets. With both forms of closet
thorough ventilation or draft is essential, and this is obtained usually
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[ 20 ]</span>
by connecting the closet vent pipe to a chimney flue or extending
it well above the ridge-pole of the building. The contents of the
container should always be submerged and very low temperatures
guarded against.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe34_1875" id="fig14">

</div>

<p>As to the germicidal results obtained in chemical closets, few data
are available. A disinfecting compound may not sterilize more
than a thin surface layer of the solid matter deposited. Experiments
by Dr. Alvah H. Doty with various agents recommended and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[ 21 ]</span>
widely used for the bedside sterilization of feces showed "that at
the end of 20 hours of exposure to the disinfectant but one-eighth
of an inch of the fecal mass was disinfected."<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Plainly, then, to destroy all bacterial and parasitic
life in chemical closets three things are necessary:
(1) A very powerful agent; (2) permeation of the
fecal mass by the agent; (3) retention of its
strength and potency until permeation is complete.
The compounds or mixtures commonly used in
chemical closets are of two general kinds: First,
those in which some coal-tar product or other oily
disinfectant is used to destroy germs and deodorize,
leaving the solids
little changed in
form; second,
those of the caustic
class that dissolve
the solids,
which, if of sufficient strength and permeating every portion, should
destroy most if not all bacterial life. Not infrequently the chemical
solution is intended to accomplish disinfection, deodorization, and
reduction to a liquid or semiliquid state.</p>

<p>A simple type of chemical closet is shown in <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>, and the
essential features are indicated in the notation. These closets with
vent pipe and appurtenances, ready for setting up, retail for $20
and upward. A chemical tank closet, retailing for about $80 per
seat, is shown in <a href="#fig16">figure 16</a>.</p>

<p>The Department of Agriculture occasionally receives complaints
from people who have installed chemical closets, usually on the
score of odors or the cost of chemicals.</p>


<h3><a id="LIQUEFYING_CLOSET"></a>LIQUEFYING CLOSET.</h3>

<p>Another type of sanitary privy, known as a liquefying closet,
makes use of bacterial action as an aid to disposal. The excretions
are deposited in a tight receptacle containing water, where fermentation
and decomposition reduce a large part of the organic solids to
liquid and gaseous forms. Much of the liquid evaporates and the
gases diffuse, so that the volume of sewage is reduced materially.
More or less insoluble and undigested residue, known as sludge, gradually
accumulates at the bottom of the receptacle, which from time
to time must be cleaned out. Disposal of the partially clarified liquid
and the sludge, however, involves much less labor than would be
needed to handle the untreated excrements.</p>

<p>Liquefying closets have been used many years with fair satisfaction.
The receptacle sometimes is a tight brick vault, but more frequently
a barrel or hogshead with one end nearly flush with the
ground. Over this is mounted the seat, sometimes with iron bars
beneath to prevent accident to small children, and the whole is inclosed
in a small frame house. The vault usually is bailed or pumped
out two or three times a year.</p>

<p>Upon farms where slope, soil, and drainage conditions are favorable
the effluent from liquefying closets may be distributed and
aerated by means of drain tile laid in the top soil or in shallow beds
filled with cinders, coke, gravel, or stone. <a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a> shows a simple
one-chamber liquefying closet with shallow distribution of the effluent
in a stone-filled trench. The vault or tank consists of vitrified
sewer pipe, a simple and cheap construction. Where a larger vault
is required concrete or brick may be used, the usual capacity being
12 or 13 gallons to a person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[ 24 ]</span></p>

<p>Faults in liquefying closets are objectionable odor, clogging of
the screen over the outlet, or insufficient water in the vault to insure
proper bacterial action. A ventilating pipe should be provided
extending from beneath the seat to above the roof. The outlet pipe
should not be less than 4 inches in diameter, and the mesh of the
screen should not be less than one-fourth inch. The contents of
the vault should be diluted with water at intervals, depending upon
the number of persons using the closet and the rapidity of evaporation.
Dilution may be effected by pouring in 1 or 2 gallons with a
pail, or a small pipe may be led from the eaves trough of the closet
to the vault. The effluent may be light colored and apparently inoffensive,
but it still is sewage, and therefore the distributing tile
never should be laid in the vicinity of a well or spring.</p>


<h3><a id="DISINFECTANTS_AND_DEODORANTS"></a>DISINFECTANTS AND DEODORANTS.</h3>

<p>Disinfection is the destruction of disease germs. Sterilization is
the destruction of all germs or bacteria, both the harmful and the
useful. Antisepsis is the checking or restraining of bacterial
growth. Deodorization is the destruction of odor. Unfortunately
in practice none of these processes may be complete. The agent may
be of inferior quality, may have lost its potency, or may not reach
all parts of the mass treated. A disinfectant or germicide is an
agent capable of destroying disease germs; an antiseptic is an agent
merely capable of arresting bacterial growth, and it may be a dilute
disinfectant; a deodorant is an agent that tends to destroy odor, but
whose action may consist in absorbing odor or in masking the original
odor with another more agreeable one.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Those desiring more explicit information on disinfectants and the principles of disinfection
are referred to U. S. Department of Agriculture Farmers' Bulletins 926, "Some
Common Disinfectants," and 954, "The Disinfection of Stables," and to publications of
the U. S. Public Health Service.</p></div>

<p>Of active disinfecting agents, heat from fire, live steam, or boiling
water is the surest. The heat generated by the slaking of quicklime
has proved effective with small quantities of excreta. Results
of tests by the Massachusetts State Board of Health<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> show that
the preferable method consists in adding sufficient hot water (120°
to 140° F.) to cover the excrement in the receptacle, then adding
small pieces of fresh strong quicklime in amount equal to about
one-third of the bulk of water and excrement combined, covering
the receptacle, and allowing it to stand 1&frac12; hours or longer.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Among chemical disinfectants a strong solution of sodium hydroxide
(caustic soda) or potassium hydroxide (caustic potash, lye) is
very effective and is useful in dissolving grease and other organic
substances. Both chemicals are costly, but caustic soda is less expensive
than caustic potash and constitutes most of the ordinary
commercial lyes. Chlorinated lime (chloride of lime, bleaching
powder) either in solution or in powdered form is valuable. For
the disinfection of stools of typhoid-fever patients the Virginia
State Board of Health<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> recommends thoroughly dissolving &frac12;
pound of best chloride of lime in 1 gallon of water and allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[ 25 ]</span>
the solution to cover the feces for at least 1 hour. The solution
should be kept in well-stoppered bottles and used promptly, certainly
within 2 or 3 days. Copper sulphate (blue vitriol, bluestone)
in a 5 per cent solution (1 pound in 2&frac12; gallons of water) is a good
but rather costly disinfectant. None of the formulas here given
is to be construed as fixed and precise. Conditions may vary the
proportions, as they always will vary the results. The reader should
remember that few, if any, chemical disinfectants can be expected
fully to disinfect or sterilize large masses of excrement unless the
agent is used repeatedly and in liberal quantities or mechanical
means are employed to secure thorough incorporation.</p>

<p>Among deodorants some of the drying powders mentioned below
possess more or less disinfecting power. Chloride of lime, though
giving off an unpleasant odor of chlorine, is employed extensively.
Lime in the form of either quicklime or milk of lime (whitewash)
is much used and is an active disinfectant. To prepare milk of lime
a small quantity of water is slowly added to good fresh quicklime
in lumps. As soon as the quicklime is slaked a quantity of water,
about four times the, quantity of lime, is added and stirred thoroughly.
When used as a whitewash the milk of lime is thinned as
desired with water and kept well stirred. Liberal use of milk of
lime in a vault or cesspool, though it may not disinfect the contents,
is of use in checking bacterial growth and abating odor. To give the
best results it should be used frequently, beginning when the vault or
cesspool is empty. Iron sulphate (green vitriol, copperas) because
of its affinity for ammonia and sulphides is used as a temporary
deodorizer in vaults, cesspools, and drains; 1 pound dissolved in 4
gallons of water makes a solution of suitable strength.</p>


<h3><a id="PREVENTION_OF_PRIVY_NUISANCE"></a>PREVENTION OF PRIVY NUISANCE.</h3>

<p>The following is a summary of simple measures for preventing a
privy from becoming a nuisance:</p>

<p>1. Locate the privy inconspicuously and detached from the
dwelling.</p>

<p>2. Make the receptacle or vault small, shallow, easy of access, and
water-tight.</p>

<p>3. Clean out the vault often. Do not wait until excrement has
accumulated and decomposition is sufficiently advanced to cause
strong and foul odors.</p>

<p>4. Sprinkle into the vault daily loose dry soil, ashes, lime, sawdust,
ground gypsum (land plaster), or powdered peat or charcoal. These
will absorb liquid and odor, though they may not destroy disease
germs.</p>

<p>5. Make the privy house rain-proof; ventilate it thoroughly, and
screen all openings.</p>

<h3><a id="OBJECTION_TO_PRIVIES"></a>OBJECTION TO PRIVIES.</h3>

<p>All the methods of waste disposal heretofore described are open to
the following objections:</p>

<p>1. They do not take care of kitchen slops and liquid wastes incipient
to a pressure water system.</p>

<p>2. They retain filth for a considerable period of time with probability
of odors and liability of transmission of disease germs.</p>

<p>3. They require more personal attention and care than people generally
are willing to give.</p>

<p>By far the most satisfactory method yet devised of caring for
sewage calls for a supply of water and the flushing away of all
wastes as soon as created through a water-tight sewer to a place
where they undergo treatment and final disposal.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="KITCHEN-SINK_DRAINAGE">KITCHEN-SINK DRAINAGE.</h2>
</div>


<p>A necessity in every dwelling is effective disposal of the kitchen-sink
slops. This necessity ordinarily arises long before the farm
home is supplied with water under pressure and the conveniences
that go with it. Hence the first call for information on sewage disposal
is likely to relate merely to sink drainage. This waste water
though it may not be as dangerous to health as sewage containing
human excrements is still a menace to the farm well and capable of
creating disagreeable odor.</p>

<p>The usual method of disposing of sink slops is to allow them to
dribble on or beneath the surface of the ground close to the house.
Such drainage should be taken in a water-tight carrier at least 100
feet downhill from the well and discharged below the surface of the
ground. Every sink should be provided with a suitable screen to
keep all large particles out of the waste pipe. An approved form of
sink strainer consists of a brass plate bolted in position over the outlet
and having at least 37 perforations not larger than one-fourth
inch in diameter. Provided a sink is thus equipped and is given
proper care and the land has fair slope and drainage, the waste water
may be conducted away through a water-tight sewer and distributed
in the soil by means of a short blind drain. The blind drain may be
conveniently made of drain tile in the manner shown in <a href="#fig17">figure 17</a>.
A simple installation, consisting of a kitchen sink and pump and
means of disposal as described, is shown in <a href="#fig18">figure 18</a>.</p>

<p>Where farms have water under pressure an open or leaching cesspool
is a common method of disposing of the sewage. Ordinary
cesspools are circular excavations in the ground, lined with stone or
brick laid without mortar. They vary from 5 to 10 feet in diameter
and from 7 to 12 feet in depth. Sometimes the top is arched and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[ 27 ]</span>
capped at the ground surf ace by a cover of wood, stone, or cast iron.
At other times the walls are carried straight up and boards or planks
are laid, across for a cover, and the entire structure is hidden with a
hedge or shrubbery.</p>

  suction pipe should be laid below frost and on a smooth upward grade from cistern
  to pump and be provided with a foot valve (<i>N</i>) to keep the pump primed. If a foot
  valve is used, pump and pipe must be safe from frost or other means than tripping
  the pump be provided for draining the system.</div>
</div>

<p>Except under the most favorable conditions the construction and
use of a cesspool can not be condemned too strongly. They are only
permissible where no other arrangement is possible. Leaching cesspools
especially are open to these serious objections:</p>

<p>1. Unless located in porous soil, stagnation is likely to occur,
and failure of the liquid to seep away may result in overflow on
the surface of the ground and the creation of a nuisance and a
menace.</p>

<p>2. They retain a mass of filth in a decomposing condition deep in
the ground where it is but slightly affected by the bacteria and air
of the soil. In seeping through the ground it may be strained, but
there can be no assurance that the foul liquid with little improvement
in its condition may not pass into the ground water and pollute
wells and springs situated long distances away in the direction of
underground flow.</p>

<p>For the purpose of avoiding soil and ground-water pollution cesspools
have been made of water-tight construction and the contents
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[ 28 ]</span>
removed by bailing or pumping. Upon the farm, however, this type
of construction has little to recommend it, for the reason that facilities
for removing and disposing of the contents in a clean manner are
lacking.</p>

<p>In some instances cesspools have been made water-tight, the outflow
being effected by three or four elbows or <b>T</b>-branches set in the
masonry near the top, with the inner ends turned down below the
water surface, the whole surrounded to a thickness of several feet
with stone or gravel intended to act as a filtering medium. Tests of
the soil water adjacent to cesspools of this type show that no reliance
should be placed upon them as a means of purifying sewage, the
fatal defects being constant saturation with sewage and lack of air
supply. To the extent that the submerged outlets keep back grease
and solid matters the scheme is of service in preventing clogging
of the pores of the surrounding ground.</p>

<p>Where the ground about a cesspool has become clogged and water-logged,
relief is often secured by laying, several lines of drain
tile at shallow depth, radiating from the cesspool. The ends of the
pipes within the cesspool should turn down, and it is advantageous
to surround the lines of pipe with stones or coarse gravel, as shown
in figures 17 and 18 and discussed under "<a href="#SEPTIC_TANKS">Septic tanks</a>." In this
way not only is the area' of percolation extended, but aeration and
partial purification of the sewage are effected.</p>

<p>Where a cesspool is located at a distance from a dwelling and
there is opportunity to lead a vent pipe up the side of a shed, barn,
or any stable object it is advisable to do so for purposes of ventilation.
Where the conditions are less favorable it may be best,
because of the odor, to omit any direct vent pipe from the cesspool
and rely for ventilation on the house sewer and main soil stack extending
above the roof of the house.</p>

<p>Cesspools should be emptied and cleaned at least once a year and
the contents given safe burial or, with the requisite permission,
wasted in some municipal sewerage system. After cleaning, the
walls and bottom may be treated with a disinfectant or a deodorant.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="SEPTIC_TANKS">SEPTIC TANKS.</h2>
</div>


<p>A tight, underground septic tank with shallow distribution of the
effluent in porous soil generally is the safest and least troublesome
method of treating sewage upon the farm, while at the same time
more or less of the irrigating and manurial value of the sewage may
be realized.</p>

<p>The late Prof. Kinnicutt used to say that a septic tank is "simply
a cesspool, regulated and controlled." The reactions described under
the captions "<a href="#HOW_SEWAGE_DECOMPOSES">How sewage decomposes</a>," "<a href="#LIQUEFYING_CLOSET">Liquefying closet</a>," and
"<a href="#CESSPOOLS">Cesspools</a>" take place in septic tanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[ 29 ]</span></p>

<p>In all sewage tanks, whatever their size and shape, a portion of
the solid matter, especially if the sewage contains much grease, floats
as scum on the liquid, the heavier solids settle to form sludge, while
finely divided solids and matter in a state of emulsion are held in
suspension. If the sludge is retained in the bottom of the tank and
converted or partly converted into liquids and gases the tank is called
a septic tank and the process is known as septicization. The process
is sometimes spoken of as one of digestion or rotting.</p>

<p><b>History.</b>&mdash; Prototypes of the septic tank were known in Europe
nearly 50 years ago. Between 1876 and 1893 a number of closed tanks
with submerged inlets and outlets embodying the principle of storage
of sewage and liquefaction of the solids were built in the United States
and Canada. It was later seen that many of the early claims for the
septic process were extravagant. In recent years septic tanks have
been used mainly in small installations, or, where employed in large
installations, the form has been modified to secure digestion of the
sludge in a separate compartment, thus in a measure obviating disadvantages
that exist where septicization takes place in the presence
of the entering fresh sewage.</p>

<p><b>Purposes.</b>&mdash;The purposes of a septic tank are to receive all the farm
sewage, as defined on <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>, hold it in a quiet state for a time,
thus causing partial settlement of the solids, and by nature's processes
of decomposition insure, as fully as may be, the destruction of
the organic matter.</p>

<p><b>Limitations.</b>&mdash;That a septic tank is a complete method of sewage
treatment is a widespread but wrong impression. A septic tank
does not eliminate odor and does not destroy all organic solids. On
the contrary, foul odors develop, and of all the suspended matter in
the sewage about one-third escapes with the effluent, about one-third
remains in the tank, and about one-third only is destroyed or reduced
to liquids and gases. The effluent is foul and dangerous. It may contain
even more bacteria than the raw sewage, since the process involves
intensive growths. As to the effects upon the growth and virulence
of disease germs little is known definitely. It is not believed
that such germs multiply under the conditions prevailing in a septic
tank. If disease germs are present many of their number along with
other bacteria may pass through with the flow or may be enmeshed
in the settling solids and there survive a long time. Hence the farmer
should safeguard wells and springs from the seepage or discharges
from a septic tank as carefully as from those of liquefying closets
and cesspools.</p>

<p><b>Further treatment of effluents.</b>&mdash;The effluent of a septic tank or any
other form of sewage tank is foul and dangerous. Whether or not
the solids are removed by screening, by short periods of rest, as in
plain or modified forms of settling tanks, or by longer quiescence,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[ 30 ]</span>
as in septic tanks, the effluent generally requires further treatment
to reduce the number of harmful organisms and the liability of
nuisance. This further treatment usually consists of some mode of
filtration. In the earliest example of such treatment the sewage
was used to irrigate land by either broad flooding or furrow irrigation.
By another method the sewage is distributed underground by
means of drain tile laid with open joints, as illustrated in figures
<a href="#fig17">17</a>, <a href="#fig29">29</a>, and <a href="#fig32">32</a>.</p>

<p>Artificial sewage filters are composed of coarse sand, screened
gravel, broken stone, coke, or other material, and the sewage is
applied in numerous ways. Since filtration is essentially an oxidizing
process requiring air, the sewage is applied intermittently in
doses.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Artificial filters of various types are well described and illustrated in Public Health
Bulletin No. 101, "Studies of Methods for the Treatment and Disposal of Sewage&mdash;The
Treatment of Sewage from Single Houses and Small Communities." U. S. Public Health
Service, December, 1919.</p></div>

<p>If properly designed and operated, filters of sand, coke, or stone
are capable of excellent results. Under the most favorable conditions
it is unwise to discharge the effluent of a sewage filter in the
near vicinity of a source of water supply. Under farm conditions
filters are usually neglected or the sewage is improperly applied,
resulting in the clogging and befouling of sand filters and the discharge
from stone filters of an effluent which is practically as dangerous
and even more offensive than raw sewage. Moreover unless the
filters are covered there are likely to be annoying odors, and there
is always the possibility of disease germs being carried by flies where
sewage is exposed in the vicinity of dwellings. Hence it seems more
practical for the farmer, avoiding the expense of earth embankments
or masonry sides and bottom for a filter bed, to waste the tank
effluent beneath the surface of such area of land as is most suitable
and available. This method of applying sewage to the soil or subsoil
is often spoken of as subirrigation, but subsoil distribution of
sewage is different in principle and practice from subirrigation for
the increase of crop yields. Subirrigation is rarely successful unless
the land is nearly level, the top soil porous and underlaid with an
impervious stratum to hold the water within reach of plant roots,
and unless a relatively large quantity of water is used and the work
is skillfully done. On the other hand, the quantity of sewage on
farms being small, it may be wasted in hilly ground, which should be
as porous, deeply drained, and dry as possible.</p>

<p><b>Parts of a system.</b>&mdash;The four parts of a septic-tank installation with
subsurface distribution of the effluent are outlined in <a href="#fig19">figure 19</a>: (1)
The house sewer from house to tank; (2) the sewage tank consisting
of one or more chambers; (3) the sewer from tank to distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[ 31 ]</span>
field; (4) the distribution field, where the sewage is distributed and
wasted, sometimes called the absorption field. These parts will be
discussed in the order named, although the last should have the first
consideration.</p>

</div>

<p><b>House sewer.</b>&mdash;The length will vary with the slope of the ground
and position of buildings, well, and distribution field. Fifty to 100
feet is a fair length; a greater is still more sanitary. Wherever possible
the house sewer should be laid straight in line and grade. <a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a>
shows how this work may be done. Suppose the distance from
A to E be 100 feet; that grade boards be set 25 feet apart crosswise
of the trench at A, B, C, D, and E; that the ground at A be 4 feet
lower than at E; that the top of the sewer be 2&frac12; feet below the surface
of the ground at A and 4&frac12; feet below the surface of the ground at E;
the fall of the sewer between A and E is 2 feet (4 + 2&frac12; - 4&frac12; = 2). If
the fall in 100 feet be 2 feet, in 25 feet it is one-fourth as much, or 6
inches. Hence, grade board B is 6 inches higher than grade board
A, C is 6 inches higher than B, and so on to E. The top edges when
all the boards are set with a carpenter's level and fastened in position
should be in line. The grade thus established may be any convenient
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[ 32 ]</span>
height above the top of the proposed sewer, and the measuring
stick used to grade the pipe is cut accordingly. This height is
usually a certain number of whole feet. Fixing the line of the sewer
is a mere matter of settling nails in the top edges of boards A and E
directly over the center of the proposed sewer and tightly stretching
a fish line or grade cord; nails should be set where the cord crosses
boards B, C, and D.</p>

<p>If the cellar or basement contains plumbing fixtures, the house
sewer should enter 1 to 2 feet below the cellar floor. If all plumbing
fixtures are on the floors above, the sewer may enter at no greater
depth than necessary to insure protection from frost outside the cellar
wall. Digging the trench and laying the pipe should begin at the
tank or lower end. The large end of the pipes, called the hub, should
face uphill, and the barrel of each pipe should have even bearing
throughout its length. Sufficient earth should be removed from beneath
the hubs to permit the joints to be made in a workmanlike
manner.</p>

<p>The house sewer may be vitrified salt-glazed sewer pipe, concrete
pipe, or cast-iron soil pipe. The latter, with poured and calked
lead joints makes a permanently water-tight and root-proof sewer,
which always should be used where the vicinity of a well must be
passed; 4, 5, or 6-inch pipe may be used, depending mainly on the fall
and in less degree on the quantity of sewage discharged. As a measure
of economy the 4-inch size is favored for iron pipe. If vitrified
pipe is used, either the 5 or 6 inch size is preferable, as these sizes are
made straighter than the 4-inch size and are less liable to obstruction.
Of the two the 5-inch size is preferable. The fall in 100 feet should
never be less than 2 feet for 4-inch size, 1&frac12; feet for 5-inch size,
1 foot for 6-inch size.</p>

  <div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>&mdash;How to make good joints. See text for directions and specifications.</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>A</i> shows the use of a yarning iron to pack a small strand of jute into the
joint space, thus centering the pipes and preventing the joint filler running inside.
The joint surfaces should be free of dirt and oil. The jute is cut in lengths to
go around the pipe; a small strand is soaked in neat Portland cement grout, then
twisted and wrapped around the small end of the pipe to be pushed into the
hub of the last pipe laid. After the pipe is pushed home the jute is packed
evenly to a depth of not over &frac12; inch, leaving about 1&frac12; inches for the joint filler.
Old hemp rope or oakum dipped in liquid cement or paper may be used in place
of jute, and the packing may be done with a thin file or piece of wood.</p>

<p><i>B</i> shows the use of a rubber mitten or glove to force Portland cement mortar
into the joint space. The mortar should be thoroughly and freshly mixed in the
proportion of one volume of cement to one volume of clean sand and should be
pressed and tamped to fill the joint completely.</p>

<p><i>C</i> shows a section of finished joint. The fresh mortar should not be loosened
or disturbed when laying the next pipe.</p>

<p><i>D</i> shows method of pouring a joint with grout, which is quicker, cheaper, and
better than using a rubber mitten. A flexible sheet-metal form or mold, oiled
to prevent the grout sticking, is clamped tightly around the joint and is completely
filled with grout consisting of equal parts of Portland cement and clean
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[ 33 ]</span>
sand mixed dry, to which water is added to produce a creamy consistency. The
pipes should not be disturbed and the form should not be removed for 24 hours.</p>

<p><i>E</i> shows a section of grouted joint, well rounded out, strong, and tight.</p>

<p><i>F</i> shows the use of a pipe jointer for pouring a hot filler. The pipe jointer
may be an asbestos or rubber runner or collar or a piece, of garden hose clamped
around the pipe leaving a small triangular opening at the top. The jointer is
pressed firmly against the hub, and any small openings between the jointer and
pipe are smeared with plastic clay to prevent leakage of the filler. A clay dike
or funnel about 3 inches high built around the triangular opening greatly aids
rapid and complete filling of the joint space. The filler may be a commercially
prepared bituminous compound or molten sulphur and fine sand. The former
makes a slightly elastic joint; the latter a hard unyielding joint. With good
workmanship both kinds of joint are practically water-tight and root-proof,
and cost about the same as cement mortar joints. The filler is heated in an iron
kettle over a wood, coke, or coal fire. It should be well stirred, and when at a
free running consistency should be poured with a ladle large enough to fill the
joint completely at one operation. As soon as the compound cools the jointer
is removed. Sulphur-sand filler is made by mixing together dry and melting
equal volumes of ordinary powdered sulphur and very fine clean sand, preferably
the finest quicksand. A 5-inch sewer pipe joint requires from three-tenths
to nine-tenths of a pound (according to the kind of pipe) of sulphur, worth 3 to
5 cents per pound, and a like quantity of sand. From &frac12; to 1&frac12; pounds of bituminous
filler are required for a 5-inch pipe joint.</p>

<p><i>G</i> shows section of finished joint.</p>

<p><i>H</i> shows the use of a pouring ladle in making lead joints in cast-iron soil pipe.
This pipe is in lengths to lay 5 feet, and the metal of the barrel is &frac14; inch thick.
The joint is yarned with dry jute or oakum, as described above, and is poured
full with molten, soft, pig lead to be afterwards driven tightly with hammer and
calking tools. About 1 pound of lead for each inch in diameter of pipe is
required. Prepared cements of varying composition have proved effective,, and,
as they require no calking, are economical. Among the best is a finely ground,
thoroughly mixed compound of iron, sulphur, slag, and salt.</p>

<p><i>I</i> is a home-made pipe jointer or clay roll for use in pouring molten lead. A
strand of jute long enough to encircle the pipe and the ends to fold back, leaving
an opening at the top, is covered with clay moistened, rolled, and worked to form
a plastic rope about 1 inch in diameter. The jointer gives the very best results
but must be frequently moistened and worked to keep the clay soft and pliable.
The jointer shown in <i>F</i> is frequently used for pouring lead joints.</p></div>

<p>Obstructions in house sewers are frequent. Among the causes
are broken pipes, grade insufficient to give cleansing velocities, newspaper,
rags, garbage, or other solids in the sewage, congealing of
grease in pipes and main running traps (house sewer traps), and
poor joint construction whereby rootlets grow into the sewer and
choke it. Good grade and good construction, with particular care
given to the joints, will avert or lessen these troubles. The sewer
should be perfectly straight, with the interior of the joints scraped
or swabbed smooth. When the joint-filling material has set, the
hollows beneath the hubs should be filled with good earth free of
stones, well tamped or puddled in place. It is important that like
material be used at the sides of the pipe and above it for at least
1 foot. The back filling may be completed with scraper or plow.
No running trap should be placed on the house sewer, because it
is liable to become obstructed and it prevents free movement of air
through the sewer and soil stack. Conductors or drains for rain
or other clean water should never connect with the house sewer,
but should discharge into a watercourse or other outlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[ 34 ]</span></p>

<p>Where obstruction of a house sewer occurs, use of some of the
simple tools shown in <a href="#fig22">figure 22</a> may remedy the trouble. It is not
likely that farmers will have these appliances, except possibly some
of the augers; but some of them can be made at home or by a blacksmith,
and most of
them should be obtainable for temporary use from a well-organized town or
city sewer department. The purpose of
the several tools
shown is indicated in
the notation.</p>

<p><b>The tank.</b>&mdash;The
septic tank should be
in an isolated location
at least 50 to 100 feet
from any dwelling.
This is not always
possible, because of
flat ground, but in
many such instances
reasonable distance
and fall may be secured
by raising both
the house sewer and
tank and embanking
them with earth.
Cases are known
where tanks adjoin
cellar or basement
walls and the top of
the tank is used as a
doorstep; in other
cases tanks have been
constructed within
buildings. Such practices
are bad. It is
difficulty to construct an absolutely water-tight masonry tank, and
still more difficult to make it proof against the passage of sewage odors.</p>

<p>In Northern States, particularly in exposed situations, it is desirable
to have the top of the tank 1 to 2 feet underground, thus
promoting warmth and uniformity of temperature in the sewage.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[ 35 ]</span>
In Southern States this feature is less important, and the top of the
tank may be flush with the ground. Every tank should be tightly
covered, for the reason above stated and to guard against the spread
of odors, the transmission of disease germs by flies, and accidents to
children.</p>

  length).</div>
</div>

<p>Considerable latitude is allowable in the design and construction
of septic tanks. No particular shape or exact dimensions can be
presented for a given number of people. One family of 5 persons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[ 36 ]</span>
may use as much water as another family of 10 persons; hence the
quantity of sewage rather than the number of persons is the better
basis of design. Exact dimensions are not requisite, for settlement
and septicization proceed whether the sewage is held a few hours
more or a few hours less. As to materials of construction some form
of masonry, either brick, building tile, rubble, concrete, or cement
block, is employed generally. Vitrified pipe, steel, and wood have
been used occasionally.</p>

<p>A plant for use all year round should have two chambers, one to
secure settlement and septicization of the solids and the other to
secure periodic discharge of the effluent by the use of an automatic
sewage siphon. The first chamber is known as the settling chamber,
the second as the siphon or dosing chamber. The siphon chamber is
often omitted and the effluent is allowed to dribble away through subsurface
tile, as illustrated in figures <a href="#fig17">17</a> and <a href="#fig18">18</a>. The latter procedure
is not generally advised, but may be permissible where the land
slopes sharply or has long periods of rest, as at summer houses and
camps.</p>

<p>The septic tanks shown in this bulletin are designed to satisfy
the following conditions:</p>

<p>1. Water consumption of 40 gallons per person per day of 24
hours.</p>

<p>2. A detention period of about 24 hours; that is, the capacity of the
settling chamber below the flow line is approximately equal to the
quantity of sewage
discharged from the
house in 24 hours.</p>

<p>3. Where a siphon
chamber is
provided, its size is
such that the dose of
sewage shall be approximately
equal
to 20 gallons per
person; that is, the
capacity of the siphon
chamber between
the discharge
and low-water lines
is roughly equal to
the quantity of sewage
discharged in
12 hours.</p>

  than a tight cesspool. Brick construction, heavily plastered

</div>

<p>A simple one-chamber brick tank suitable for a household discharging
180 to 280 gallons of sewage daily is shown in <a href="#fig23">figure 23</a>. A
small two-chamber tank constructed of 24-inch vitrified pipe, suitable
for a household discharging about 125 gallons of sewage daily, is
shown in <a href="#fig24">figure 24</a>. A typical two-chamber concrete tank is shown in
<a href="#fig25">figure 25</a>. Excepting the submerged outlet, all pipes within the tank
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[ 37 ]</span>
and built into the masonry are cast-iron soil pipe with cast-iron fittings.
Vitrified or concrete sewer pipe and specials are generally
used as they are frequently more readily obtainable and a slight
saving in first cost may be effected. Cast iron is less liable to be
broken in handling or after being set rigidly in masonry, and the
joints are more easily made water-tight. The submerged outlet is
midway of the depth of liquid in the settling chamber. The inside
depth of the siphon chamber is the drawing depth of the siphon
plus 1 foot 5 inches.</p>

<p><b>Siphons.</b>&mdash;Reference has already been made to the vital importance
of air in sewage filtration. If the spaces within a filter or soil are
constantly filled with water, air is excluded, and the action of the
filtering material is merely that of a mechanical strainer with its
clogging tendency. The purpose of a siphon is twofold: (1) To secure
intermittent discharge, thus allowing a considerable period of
time for one dose to work off in the soil and for air to enter the soil
spaces before another flush is received; (2) to secure distribution
over a larger area and in a more even manner than where the sewage
is allowed to dribble and produce the conditions of the old-fashioned
sink drain&mdash;namely, a small area of water-logged ground.</p>

<p>Three types of sewage siphon are shown in <a href="#fig26">figure 26</a>. In all, the
essential principle is the same: A column of air is entrapped between
two columns of water; when the water in the chamber rises to a
predetermined height, called the discharge line, the pressure forces
out the confined air, destroying the balance and causing a rush of
water through the siphon to the sewer. The entire operation is automatic
and very simple. The siphons shown are commercial products
made of cast iron; they have few parts and none that move, and the
whole construction is simple and durable. The table (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>) lists
stock sizes adapted to farm use. Manufacturers furnish full information
for setting their siphons and putting them in operation. For
example, take type 2, <a href="#fig26">figure 26</a>: (1) Set siphon trap (<b>U</b>-shaped pipe)
plumb, making E (height from floor to top of long leg) as specified;
(2) fill siphon trap with water till it begins to run out at B; (3)
place bell in position on top of long leg, and the siphon is ready for
service. Do not fill vent pipe on side of bell.</p>

<div class="pmt2 pmb2 smaller">[Transcriber Note: The data for Type 1 Siphon has been added to the table.]</div>

  <div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Three types of sewage siphon. The table gives dimensions for setting standard
  3 and 4 inch siphons; also the appropriate size and grade of the sewer to carry the
  siphon discharge.</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[ 40 ]</span></p>

<p>The overhead siphon, type 3, <a href="#fig26">figure 26</a>, may be installed readily
in a tank already built by addition of an outlet sump. If properly
set and handled, sewage siphons require very little attention and
flush with certainty. Like all plumbing fixtures they are liable to
stoppage if rags, newspaper, and similar solids get into the sewage.
If fouling of the sniffing hole or vent prevents the entrance of sufficient
air into the bell to lock the siphon properly, allowing sewage
to dribble through, the remedy is to clean the siphon. Siphons are
for handling liquid; sludge if allowed to accumulate will choke them.</p>

<p><b>Submerged outlet.</b>&mdash;The purpose of a submerged outlet is to take
the outflow from a point between the sludge at the bottom and the
floating solids or scum. The outlet in <a href="#fig25">figure 25</a> may be readily made
of sheet metal by a tinsmith. Wrought iron or steel pipe with
elbows or light lead pipe may be used, the pipe being set in the
concrete and left in place. Sometimes a galvanized wire screen
(&frac14;-inch mesh) is fitted over the inner end to prevent large solids
leaving the settling chamber and possibly clogging the siphon or
distribution tile. If a screen is used it should be easily removable
for cleaning.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe24_8125" id="fig27">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig27.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;Home-made reinforced concrete covers. (1) Slabs placed crosswise permit uncovering
  the whole tank for cleaning, but as inspection is somewhat difficult, cleaning
  is the more likely to be neglected; (2) manhole, 18 inches square; cover, 22 by 22 by 3
  inches thick, easy to make and to slide or lift from the opening.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Manhole frame and cover.</b>&mdash;The frame and cover shown in <a href="#fig25">figure 25</a>
are stock patterns made of cast iron and weighing about 250 pounds
per set. The cover is 21 inches in diameter; it is tight and, on
account of its weight, is unlikely to be disturbed by small children.
The frame or rim is about 7 inches high and 31 inches in longest
diameter. If desired, light cast-iron cistern or cesspool covers obtainable
from plumbing supply houses, home-made slabs of reinforced
concrete (see <a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>), or wooden covers (see <a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>) may be
used.</p>

<p><b>Overflow.</b>&mdash;The purpose of an overflow is to pass sewage to the distribution
field should the siphon stop working. The overflow (fig.
25) is a 3-inch riser pipe with top 3 inches above the discharge line
and the bottom calked or cemented into the side outlet of a <b>T</b>-branch.
The run of the <b>T</b>-branch should correspond with the size
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[ 41 ]</span>
of the sewer from the tank to the distribution field. If this sewer
is 4-inch pipe, a 4 by 3 inch <b>T</b>-branch is used, the 4-inch spigot end
of the siphon being calked or cemented into the branch, as shown
in <a href="#fig25">figure 25</a>; if the sewer is 5-inch, a 5 by 3 inch <b>T</b>-branch is used
and connected to the siphon with a 5-inch to 4-inch reducer (in
vitrified specials the equivalent is a 4-inch to 5-inch increaser); if
the sewer is 6-inch, a 6 by 3 inch <b>T</b>-branch is used and connected
to the siphon with a 6-inch to 4-inch reducer.</p>

<p><b>Concrete work.</b>&mdash;Before excavation for the tank is begun, two
wooden forms should be built for shaping the inside of the settling
and siphon chambers. In most instances the ground is fairly firm,
so that the lines of excavation may conform to the outside dimensions
of the tank, the back of the walls being built against the earth.
The forms may be made of square-edged boards, braced and lightly
nailed, as shown in <a href="#fig28">figure 28</a>. The forms should have no bottom.
If it is desired to lay the sides and covering slab in one operation,
the top of the forms must be boarded over. All pipe and manhole
openings should be accurately placed and cut. The faces of the
forms may be covered with paper or smeared with soap or grease to
facilitate removal later.</p>

<p>The ground should next be excavated to the proper depth for
placing the floors in both chambers. The settling chamber floor,
being the lower, should be placed first. Effort should be made to
secure water-tight work, a feature of especial importance where
leakage might endanger a well or spring. A concrete mixture of
1:2:4 is generally preferred (1 volume cement, 2 volumes sand, 4
volumes stone). The ingredients should be of best quality and thoroughly
mixed. The concrete should be poured promptly and worked
with a spade or flat shovel to make the face smooth and eliminate
pockets or voids within the mass.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Before the settling chamber floor
has hardened the form should be set upon the floor and the concrete
work continued up the sides. The pipe form for the submerged
outlet should be set. When the side walls of the settling chamber
have reached the bottom of the excavation for the siphon chamber,
the siphon trap with its connecting branch and short piece of pipe
should be set to proper line and grade and blocked in position. The
floor of the siphon chamber should now be poured and the form for
that chamber placed thereon, leaving a 6-inch or 8-inch space (according
to the thickness of the division wall) between the ends of
the two forms. Pouring of all side walls and the top slab should
continue without stop, making the entire structure a monolith.</p>

1 to 2 weeks.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Steel reinforcement.</b>&mdash;To stiffen the cover slab and guard against
cracking, a little steel should be embedded in the concrete about 1
inch above the inside top. For this purpose a strip of heavy stock
fencing is convenient and inexpensive. The line wires should be not
less than No. 10 gauge (about 1&#8260;8 inch) and the stay wires not less
than No. 11 gauge. The reinforcement should be cut at manholes and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[ 43 ]</span>
fastened around manhole openings. If desired a standard wire-mesh
reinforcement weighing about one-third of a pound per square foot
may be used. Another alternative is to use &frac14;-inch round rods,
spacing the crosswise rods 6 inches apart and the lengthwise rods
12 inches apart. Poultry netting should not be used, because of
its lightness.</p>

<p><b>Sewer from tank to distribution field.</b>&mdash;The length of this sewer
depends on the situation of the field and the fall to it. The size of the
sewer depends on the fall that can be obtained and the size of
siphon. The table in <a href="#fig26">figure 26</a> shows the minimum fall at which
4-inch, 5-inch, and 6-inch sewers should be laid to take the discharge
of the 3-inch and 4-inch siphons specified. The line and grade
should be set in the same manner as for the house sewer (see <a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>),
and the construction should be as specified under that caption.</p>

<p><b>Distribution field.</b>&mdash;The distribution field or area is a sewage filter,
and its selection and the manner of preparing it largely determine
the success of subsoil disposal of sewage. As a rule farm land
is not the best filtering material. It is too fine grained and fertile.
Its tendency is to hold water too long, to admit insufficient air, to
clog when even small quantities of sewage are applied. Hence the
distribution area should be of liberal size&mdash;on the average 500 square
feet for each person served. It should be dry, porous, and well
drained&mdash;qualities that characterize sandy, gravelly, and light loam
soils. It should be devoid of trees and shrubbery, thus giving sunlight
and air free access. It should be located at least 300 feet downhill
from a well or spring used for domestic water supply. Preferably
it should slope gently, but sharp slopes are not prohibitive.
Subsoiling the area is always desirable.</p>

<p>Clay and other compact, impervious soils require special treatment.
Less sewage can be applied to them, and hence it is well to
have the area larger than 500 square feet per person. Clay should
be subsoiled as deep as possible with a subsoil plow. In some instances
dynamite has been of service in opening up the ground to
still greater depth. Drainage and aeration should be further promoted
by laying tile underdrains, as outlined in <a href="#fig19">figure 19</a> and shown
in more detail in <a href="#fig31">figure 31</a>.</p>

<p>After the construction work the distribution area should be raked
and seeded with thick-growing grass. Grass is a safe crop; its water
requirement is high, and it affords considerable protection from frost.
Suitable grasses are redtop, white clover, blue grass, and Bermuda
grass. The area may be pastured or kept as grass land.</p>

<p><b>Distribution system.</b>&mdash;Poor distribution of the sewage and failure to
protect the joints of the distribution tile account for most of the
failures. Each flush of the siphon should be so controlled that every
part of the field will receive its due proportion. The distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[ 44 ]</span>
tile must be so laid that loose dirt will not fall or wash into the open
joints.</p>

<p>Different methods of dividing the flush and laying out the distribution
tile are shown in figures 29 and 32. Layouts 1, 2, and 3, <a href="#fig29">figure 29</a>,
are suitable for flat or gently sloping areas and are planned for
the shallow siphon chambers tabulated on <a href="#Dimensions_Table">page 37</a>. Layout 4, <a href="#fig29">figure 29</a>,
is suitable for steep slopes. In all four layouts use is made of
one or more <b>V</b>-branches (not <b>Y</b>-branches) to divide the flow equally
among the several lines. <b>V</b>-branches, sometimes called breeches,
should be leveled with a carpenter's level crosswise the ends of the
legs, thus insuring equal division of the flow.</p>

<p>The size and length of distribution tile and the spacing of the lines
or runs admit of considerable variation in different soils. Water
sinks rapidly in gravels and sands, and hence larger tile and shorter
length are permissible than in close soils. Lateral movement is slow
in all soils, but extends farther in gravels and sands than in close
soils. In average soils the effect on vegetation 5 feet away from the
line is practically nil.</p>

<p>From these considerations, with the siphon dose 20 gallons per
person, it is usually a safe rule to provide 50 feet of 3-inch tile for
each person served and to lay the lines 10 feet apart. Such provision
gives a capacity within the bore of the tile lines about equal
to the siphon dose, and as some sewage is wasted at each joint a
reasonable factor of safety is provided. A spacing of 10 feet will,
it is believed, permanently prevent the extension of lateral absorption
from line to line, provided the area is fairly well drained. As between
3-inch and 4-inch tile the smaller size costs less and is better
calculated to taper the dose to small proportions. Four-inch tile
is less likely to get out of alignment or to become clogged; a length
of 28 feet has the same capacity in the bore as 50 feet of 3-inch.</p>

<p>Good-quality drain tile in 1-foot lengths or second-quality sewer
pipe in 2-foot lengths may be used. The lines are generally laid in
parallel runs, but may be varied according to the topography. Layouts
1, 2, and 3, <a href="#fig29">figure 29</a>, for flat or gently sloping land, run with
the slope; layout 4, for steep slopes, runs back and forth along the
contour in a series of long flat sweeps and short steep curves. The
grade of the runs and sweeps should be gentle, rarely more than
10 or 12 inches in 100 feet. In layouts 1, 2, and 3, <a href="#fig29">figure 29</a> especially,
it is desirable that the last 20 feet of each run should be laid
level or given a slight upward slope, thus guarding against undue
flow of sewage to the lowest ends of the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[ 46 ]</span></p>

<p>The runs should be laid no deeper than necessary to give clearance
when plowing and prevent injury from frost. Ten inches of earth
above the top of the tile is sufficient generally throughout the southern
half of the United States and 18 inches generally in the North,
but if the field is exposed or lacks a thick heavy growth of grass the
cover should be increased to 2&frac12; or 3 feet near the Canadian line.
What is better, the tile in all instances may be laid with a 10-inch
cover and in cold weather the runs may be covered with hay, straw,
or leaves weighted down, which may be removed in the spring.</p>

1. <i>A</i>, Subsoil ground; <i>B</i>, 3 or 4 inch drain tile; <i>C</i>, strip of tarred paper about 6<br />
inches wide and extending three-fourths the distance around the tile, allowing sewage<br />
to escape at the bottom; <i>D</i>, coarse sand, gravel, broken stone or brick, slag, cinders, or<br />
coke, the coarsest material placed around the tile (where the ground is naturally very<br />
porous and well drained, special filling in the trench may be omitted); <i>E</i>, natural soil.<br />
<br />
2. Drain tile covered with a board laid flat, leaving the entire joint open.<br />
<br />
3. Drain tile laid in stoneware gutter pieces and the joint covered with stoneware<br />
caps; gutter and cap pieces are inexpensive commercial products; their radius is longer<br />
than that of the outside of the tile, thus leaving open most of the joint space; the gutter<br />
aids in keeping the tile in line.<br />
<br />
4. Vitrified sewer pipe with hubs facing downhill; the spigot end should be centered<br />
in the hub with a few small chinks or wedges.<br />
</p>

<p>Making the joints of the distribution tile demands especial attention.
For a short distance on the upper end of each run the tile
should be laid with ends abutting; the joint opening should be increased
gradually to one-eighth inch and this increased to one-fourth
in the last 20 feet of the run. All joints should be protected against
the entrance of loose dirt. Four methods are shown in <a href="#fig30">figure 30</a>.
The lower end of each run should be closed with a brick or flat
stone; or, what is better, an elbow or <b>T</b>-branch may be placed on the
end and vented above the surface of the ground, improving the flow
of sewage, the ventilation of pipes, and the aeration of the soil.</p>

<p>If the distribution tile must be laid in clay or other close, poorly
drained soil, special treatment is necessary. A common method is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[ 47 ]</span>
to subsoil and underdrain the area thoroughly, as shown in <a href="#fig31">figure 31</a>.
It is not always possible to run the underdrain in lines between the
distribution lines as shown in figures <a href="#fig19">19</a> and <a href="#fig31">31</a>, but it is a desirable
thing to do, as the sewage must then receive some filtration through
natural soil.</p>

<p>In some instances it is sufficient to lay the distribution tile on a continuous
bed, 8 to 12 inches thick, of coarse gravel, broken stone, or
brick, slag, coke, or cinders and complete the refill as shown in figure
<a href="#fig18">18</a> or <a href="#fig31">31</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#fig32">Figure 32</a> shows two other methods of controlling the flow on steep
slopes and diverting proper proportions to the several lateral distributors
laid along the contour of the field. This work can not be
effected properly with <b>T</b> or <b>Y</b> branches; the flow tends to shoot
straight ahead, comparatively little escaping laterally. To overcome
this difficulty recourse is had to diverting boxes, of which two types
are shown in <a href="#fig32">figure 32</a>. These boxes involve expense, but permit
inspection and division of the flow according to the needs. They may
be built of brick, stone, concrete, or even wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe25_1875" id="fig31">
  <img class="w100" src="images/fig31.png"  alt="" />
  <div class="fig_caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Close soils should be deeply subsoiled and underdrained. Porous, well-drained,
air-filled soil is absolutely necessary. <i>A</i>, Subsoiled ground; <i>B</i>, 3 or 4 inch distribution
tile; <i>C</i>, depth variable with the climate, 1&frac14; to 3&frac12; feet; <i>D</i>, 4-inch underdrain; <i>E</i>, depth
such as would prepare land for good crop production, generally 3&frac12; to 4 feet; <i>F</i>, stone
or other coarse material; <i>G</i>, gravel grading upward to coarse sand; <i>H</i>, loose soil.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Type 1 consists of a single box, into which all the lateral distributors
head. It will be noted that the laterals enter at slightly different
elevations, the two opposite the inlet sewer being the highest,
the next two slightly lower, and the next two the lowest. This staggering
of the outlets, in a measure, offsets the tendency of the flow
to shoot across and escape by the most direct route.</p>

<p>Type 2 calls for one or more diverting boxes, according to the number
of lateral distributors, and readily permits of wasting sewage at
widely separated elevations and distances. The outlet pipes enter
the box at slightly different elevations, for the reason already stated.
With either type, should the outlets not be set at the right elevations,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[ 48 ]</span>
partial plugging of the holes and a little experimenting will enable
one to equalize or proportion the discharges.</p>

  <i>E</i>, 3-inch or 4-inch distribution tile.></div>
</div>

<p><b>Sewage switch.</b>&mdash;The clogging of filters and soils after long-continued
application of sewage has been previously referred to. It
is, therefore, desirable to arrange the distribution system in two units
with a switch between them, so that one area may drain and become
aerated while the other is in use. This procedure is especially desirable
where the soil is close and the installation of considerable
size. It adds to the life and effectiveness of the distribution area and
permits use of a plant in case it is necessary to repair, extend, or relay
the tile in either unit.</p>

<p>Arrangement in two units does not necessarily mean doubling the
amount of tile and the area required in a single field. However desirable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[ 49 ]</span>
that may be, expense or lack of suitable ground will often
prevent. With open sands and gravels and the assumed siphon dose
of 20 gallons per person, 15 to 20 feet of 4-inch tile in each unit for
each person will usually suffice. With more compact soil it is advisable
to more nearly double the requirements previously described.
Two simple types of switch are shown in <a href="#fig33">figure 33</a>. The switch
should be turned frequently, certainly as often as is necessary to prevent
saturation or bogginess of either area.</p>

  bolts); <i>E</i>, sewer to distribution area; <i>F</i> (right-hand box), alternate position of outlets

</div>

<p><b>A complete installation.</b>&mdash;The general layout and working plans of
a complete installation built in 1915-16 are shown in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a>. The
plant is larger than those heretofore considered, and involves several
additional features. The settling chamber below the flow line has
a capacity of 1,000 gallons, and on a basis of 40 gallons per person
per day would serve 25 people.</p>

<p>For many years sewage had been discharged through two 4-inch
sewers to a cesspool in the rear of the house. The proximity of the
well made it unsafe, and the overflow of the cesspool dribbled over
the low portion of the garden and barnyard, creating nuisance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[ 50 ]</span></p>

<p>The first step was to make borings with a soil auger in the pasture
400 or 500 feet from the house. The borings showed a heavy clay
soil to a depth of about 4 feet, underlaid with a sandy stratum only
a few inches in thickness. It was decided to locate the distribution
area in the pasture and to aid the seepage of sewage by digging
numerous filter wells through the clay to the sandy stratum. Levels
were taken and a contour plan prepared to serve for laying out the
plant and establishing the grades.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe25_1875" id="fig34">

  garden and removal of sewage to a lower and safer location in the pasture, where the
  treatment is subsurface distribution, aided by numerous filter wells about 4 feet deep
  filled with coarse gravel. Note that sludge is removed from the bottom of the settling
  chamber by opening the gate on the sludge drain.<br />Click on image to view larger size.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[ 51 ]</span></p>

<p>The septic tank is built in one corner of the barnyard, and a 5-inch
sewer connects it with the old 4-inch sewers to the cesspool. All
sewer pipe joints were poured with a flexible jointing compound.
The settling chamber is of hopper shape at the bottom, and a 4-inch
sludge drain with gate provides for the gravity removal of sludge.
The lower end of the sludge drain is above the surface of the ground
and 9 feet below the flow line. The end is protected by a small
retaining wall, and the sludge is readily caught in barrels and
hauled out on the land for burial. The outlet is low enough to drain
the settling chamber completely. If it is desired merely to force out
the sludge, the drain may be brought to the surface under a head
of 3 to 5 feet, discharging the sludge into a trench or drying bed, to
be applied later to the land. A 2-inch waste pipe about mid-depth
of the settling chamber permits drawing off the clearer portion of
the sewage to the siphon chamber and from thence through another
2-inch waste pipe into the 6-inch sewer leading to the distribution
field.</p>

<p>The 4-inch siphon has a drawing depth of 33 inches, and as the
siphon chamber is 4 feet wide by 6 feet long the dose is about 500
gallons. The siphon cost $35. The 6-inch sewer to the switch box
falls about 6 inches in 50 feet. The distribution field was thoroughly
subsoiled, and about 800 feet of 3-inch tile was laid in each
unit. At intervals of 25 feet along the distribution trenches 6-inch
holes were dug through the clay stratum with a posthole digger.
These holes were filled with stone and constitute the filter wells previously
mentioned. All tile lines are surrounded with stone and coarse
gravel, and the ground has been trimmed to give a uniform cover of
12 inches. All work was done by day labor in a thorough manner.
As the men were doing other work at the same time the actual cost
is not known, but it is believed the installation cost about $700.</p>

<p><b>Cost data.</b>&mdash;Reliable cost figures are difficult to estimate. Labor,
materials, freight, haulage, and other items vary greatly in different
localities. The septic tank shown in <a href="#fig23">figure 23</a> contains about 1,000
bricks and is estimated to cost $60 complete. The septic tank shown
in <a href="#fig25">figure 25</a> for 5 persons is estimated to cost $135; for 10 persons,
$170; for 15 persons, $240; for 20 persons, $280. In Maryland, in
1916, the cost of installing a septic tank similar to that shown in
<a href="#fig25">figure 25</a> (for 5 people), including 86 feet of 5-inch house sewer (55
feet of cast-iron pipe passing a well, and 31 feet of vitrified pipe)
and 214 feet of second-quality 4-inch sewer pipe in the distribution
area, was as follows:</p>

<p>The cost of cast-iron fittings may be roughly estimated as follows:
Bends, one to one and one-half times the price of straight pipe; <b>T</b>-branches,
two times the price of straight pipe; reducers, average of
the prices of straight pipe at each end. The cost of clay bends,
<b>T</b>-branches, reducers, and increasers may be roughly estimated at
four times the price of straight pipe.</p>

<p><b>Operation.</b>&mdash;Attention must be given to every plant to insure success.
Unusual or excessive foulness should be investigated. No
chemicals should be used in a septic tank; garbage, rags, newspaper,
and other solids not readily soluble in water should be kept out of
sewers and tanks. The plant should be inspected often, noting particularly
if the siphon is operating satisfactorily. If scum forms
in the settling chamber it should be removed, and the sludge should
be bailed or pumped out yearly. Frequently tanks are not cleaned
out for three or four years, resulting in large quantities of solid
matter going through to the distribution system and clogging it.
Clogging may occur in the tile or in the adjacent soil. In either
case the tile should be dug up, cleaned, and relaid. In some cases
it has been found advantageous to relay the tile between the former
lines. When sewage is applied to fairly porous land at the slow
rate here recommended and the plant is well handled the tile lines
should operate satisfactorily for many years. Liming heavy soils
tends to loosen and keep them sweet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GREASE_TRAPS">GREASE TRAPS.</h2>
</div>


<p>Farm sewage may contain from 10 to 30 pounds of grease and fats
per person per year. This grease, originating mainly in the kitchen
sink, hinders septic action and clogs pipes, filters, and soils. Half
the grease may be stopped by a septic tank, but the remainder goes
into the distribution system, interfering with its action. A grease
trap is a device for separating the grease from other wastes. The
need for it may be lessened by carefully depositing waste greases and
fats with the garbage; but one should always be installed if the
kitchen is carelessly managed or discharges quantities of greasy
water as at institutions, hotels, boarding houses, and bakeshops.</p>

<p>A grease trap should have several times the capacity of the greatest
quantity of greasy water discharged into it at one time, in order
that the entering water shall be well cooled and the grease congealed.
The solidified grease rises to the surface of the water in the trap and
is retained therein. A dishpan of greasy water (2&frac12; to 3 gallons) is
the largest quantity likely to be discharged at one time from an ordinary
kitchen sink, hence the grease trap should have not less capacity
than 7 or 8 gallons. <a href="#fig35">Figure 35</a> shows three types of grease traps
suitable for farm use. In each the outlet pipe has small clearance
at the bottom. This feature, together with the <b>V</b>-shaped hopper bottom,
tends to create a scouring velocity and thus prevent the accumulation
of coffee grounds and other solid wastes in the bottom of the
trap. A grease trap should be close to the sink it is intended to serve,
but not within the kitchen, on account of objectionable odors when
the trap is opened to remove grease. It is good practice to place the
trap in the cellar or basement, where it is safe from frost yet close
to the source of grease.</p>

</div>


<p>Do not waste money by digging and, partly constructing, afterwards
seeking information. Prepare a plan and work from it. Get
in touch with your county agricultural and home demonstration
agents. Advice may be obtained also from extension workers, State
agricultural colleges, State and local boards of health, the United
States Public Health Service, and the United States Department of
Agriculture. Do not guess distances and levels. Use a measuring
tape and some type of level&mdash;engineer's, architect's, drainage, hand,
or carpenter's. Study this bulletin, and design, lay out, and construct
in accordance therewith. Remember to: (1) Isolate the septic tank&mdash;locate
it 50 to 100 or more feet from any dwelling and, if practicable,
to the leeward of prevailing summer breezes; (2) locate the cesspool
or sewage distribution field downhill from the well or spring, and, if
possible, 300 feet therefrom; (3) select dry, porous, deeply drained
ground for disposal of all sewage; (4) do not apply more sewage to a
given area of land than can be thoroughly absorbed and oxidized; (5)
lay sewers straight and below the reach of frost, ventilate them thoroughly,
and make the joints water-tight and root-proof.</p>

<p>Makeshift methods, materials, or devices should be avoided or used
sparingly. Do not place a vent pipe in the top of a cesspool or
septic tank if near a dwelling. Siphon chamber and siphon may be
omitted in those rare instances where it is feasible to discharge into
salt water or into a large stream already badly polluted. Disposal
of sewage in a running stream should be a last resort. Such practice
endangers water supplies downstream, and unless the volume and
velocity of flow are good nuisance may be created in the vicinity.
Do not neglect inspection and operation. Clean out settling tanks
yearly or oftener. All pipe lines below ground should be marked
with iron or stone markers to facilitate examination, repair, or extension
of the system.</p>

<p>There is a general but erroneous belief that the cost of sewerage
is little in the city but almost prohibitive in the country. All personal
and realty properties in one eastern city represent a valuation
of $10,382 per home, which pays $355 for sewers outside the cellar
wall. An average farm in a Middle West State represents a valuation
of $17,259. Is not the farmer justified in the small outlay required
to dispose of the farm sewage? Because of the issuance of
bonds and the apportionment of sewer assessments for a series of
years the city dweller may have his burden distributed over a long
period. The farmer does not pay interest on these obligations, and
sewer work can be done more cheaply in the country than in the city.</p>

<p>Safe disposal of farm sewage is not a passing fad but a vital necessity.
Besides being an asset a good sewerage installation greatly
promotes the wholesomeness and healthfulness of the farm. Moreover
the benefits are far-reaching, because farm products go into
every home, and farm and urban populations mingle freely.</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
